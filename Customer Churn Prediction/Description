This project predicts customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model consists of multiple dense layers with ReLU and LeakyReLU activations to capture complex patterns in the data. It uses the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 and binary crossentropy as the loss function. Categorical features are encoded using one-hot encoding, and the model is trained on 26 features for 100 epochs. The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn based on their account details and service usage.
